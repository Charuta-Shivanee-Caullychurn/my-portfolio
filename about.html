      <h2>The Short Version of My Life Story</h2>
      <p>Hey there! As you probably know by now, my name is Charuta Shivanee, but most people call me <b>Charu</b>(because, let's be real, it's easier).  I was born and raised on the beautiful island of Mauritius—yep, that tiny dot in the middle of the Indian Ocean.</p>
      <p>Right now, I’m living in <b>Malaysia</b>, pursuing a <b>Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science</b> with a specialisation in </b>Data Analytics</b>. I've always been fascinated by <b>statistics</b> and the way data shapes the world. I mean, <b>data</b> is infinite—it just keeps growing and evolving. So, in a way, you could say I’m studying this out of pure curiosity (and maybe a little obsession, haha).</p>
      <p>A fun fact? I’m a Gen Z kid through and through. Which means I spend countless hours watching reels, equally countless hours learning new programming languages, and somehow balancing it all while trying to turn my passion into a career. As a woman in tech, I know I have to push harder to carve out my place—but hey, I got this, right? 😏</p>
      <p>My life motto? "To try my best so I can never blame myself for anything." Just trusting God and myself to carve out a good life—hah!</p>
      <!--<p>And finally, shoutout to my loving and supportive parents, my sister, my uncle from Canada, and a special thought to my best friend from India—the real ones who never stopped believing in me and my potential. 💙</p>-->

    <!--Beyond Academics and Career-->
    <section class="about-section" id="beyond">
      <h2>Outside Tech? Yeah, I Actually Touch Grass..Sometimes</h2>
      <p>Sure, my skills, experience, and education play a big role in shaping who I am—but let’s be real, they’re not the only things that make me awesome. Beyond all that, I’m an adventure seeker who loves trying new things—whether it’s food, random hobbies, or starting a deep conversation about law or psychology at 2 AM for no reason.</p>
      <p>I have an unhealthy obsession with crime TV shows—which probably explains my attention to detail and my habit of trying to predict everything before it happens. (Seriously, if data analytics didn’t exist, I’d probably be out solving fake crimes in my head.) But I’m also a risk-taker—as long as the risk isn’t too sketchy. No life-threatening stunts, please.</p>
      <p>One of my best qualities? I can vibe with just about anyone. Thanks to my international exposure from my education and internship, I’ve met and learned from people of diverse backgrounds, which means I can probably blend in anywhere—put me in a room with strangers, and I’ll walk out with five new best friends and a dinner invite.</p> 
      <p>I also have a soft spot for volunteering. As a kid, I used to help out at a temple near my house, and even after moving abroad, I kept the spirit alive. In Malaysia, I volunteered for The Lost Food Project and uni events, proving that even between watching crime shows and analyzing data, I can still be a responsible human.</p>
      <p>Now, for the fun part—my hobbies? I love reading (which sounds intellectual until you realize half my time is spent reading memes), shopping, dancing, and spending quality time with friends. I’d say I’m a bubbly, energetic person who can bring life to any situation—yes, even a Monday morning meeting. If there’s one thing I do well, it’s turning dull moments into legendary ones.</p>
